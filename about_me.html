        <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
            <p title="content #1">
                I have been brewing my own beer for several years
                now and currently I have a <strong>bourbon porter</strong>
                and <strong>Belgian wheat beer</strong>, similar to Blue Moon on the yeast.  </p>

        <h2>My Greatest Accomplishment</h2>

            <p title="content #2">
                I had a L4 to S1 disk fusion surgery in 2003 and immediatley after wanted have a second child.
                The surgery had a long recovery and affected my "performance" as it were.
                Nevertheless, my wife and I worked very hard and that hard work produced my second child and first son.
            <p title="content #3">
                As SpongeBob says in the episode No Weenies Allowed after proving he was tough enough:
                <strong>"This is the hapiest day of my life!"</strong>
            </p>
                I have told my son that his importance is direct proportional to how hard I worked to have him.
            </p>

        <h2>A Short Biography</h2>

            <p title="content #4">
                At first glance, my career history might seem a bit perplexing—after all, it’s somewhat unusual to
                see “President & General Manager” next to “USPS Letter Carrier”! But that just goes to show the
                diversity of my professional experience. Although I founded, operated, and subsequently sold a highly
                successful company after 24 years, I’m the kind of person who is always eager to work and “keep busy”.</p>

            <p title="content #5">And that is precisely what I’ve done over the last several years. In beginning my second career,
                I’ve enrolled at Green River college and hope to graduate in Spring 2023 with an BAS in Software Engineering.
                From there I will continue towards a M.S. in Computer Science. I’m very intrigued by the prospect
                of working in the Data Science and Machine Learning industry, and I’m eager to see what exciting
                opportunities are out there for someone with my unique background!
